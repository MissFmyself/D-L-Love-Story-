            It were june 2019, i workd at the cruise ship between Turku-Stockholm. For last year I felt ”pain” because of my emotional life. I thought that i can’t feel love anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Into our ship cane dance group from Ukraine for two months. I worked at the ship as a security guard and it were in our protocolla that every time when they had show some of us have to stand next to the stage to secure their show. I dont know, do i believe destiny, but it were my turn to stand next to the stage. In that time i did not know that soon i will meet love of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            The show begins, loudly music and dancers walk to the stage. I look audience first and did not pay attention to dancers. Like trully finnish audience they just sit there and drink beer. I decided to watch the show. One look..... second.... fuck our eyes stuck to eachothers. We wach eachother everytime when Lida can during the show. I frozen and start to avoid her eyes, i were nervous. But i could not and  again i look at her.

            After their show i could not get her away from my mind. And it did not help that we saw eachother time to time in the ship, all the time we look eachothers. I could not forget her, i only think who is she. Her smile were the most beautiful smile ever, innocent but so sexy. Her way to walk were so smooth that make even my legs sag.
        </p>
        <p>
            They had two different show every day and yes i were volunteer to secure their show at next day also. When Lida came to the stage, i forgot audience and my eyes follow only her. We look deeply into eachother eyes. I must know atleast her name, i think. When show were i over i stay in the club and wait when she will come out from back stage. I stand there for a while and wait. Then she open that door, distance between us were like 10meters, she start ro walk to me and panic, what i will say to her. She get closer and say Hi, i said hi what is your name ? From that moment it begin, we spoke to eachother and could only smile. Lida gave me her contact so i can send message to her later. I were so happy, but after few hours ship will be in harbour and have to leave to helsinki back to home. On my way to home i send message to Lida. We chat next days and i told her that i will be back in the ship next friday and i will be there until 12.7
        </p>
        <p>
            Even i waited so much to go back to the ship, somehow i felt uncertain and i thought that maybe lida is anot interested about me.  When i saw Lida at the first time again at taxfree, she say welcome back and i just look at her and stay silence, what i was thinking? Took some time and we did not communicate anymore, we still look eachothers, but we did not spoke. When i were on my shift i saw Lida went to the deck for smoke. I wanted to go to speak to her, but i did not know what i should to say, did not know how to start conversation. What should i say we havent spoke after our messages. What if i am right and she is not interested about me?
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in the evening, when i still work, i saw Lida at messi. I sat in tv room, i saw Lida cane there with her friend. They sat other side of messi. I decided to send message to her, i took my phone and send: let’s go to smoke? At the same time i watch her reaction to my message. She said something to her friend and her friend leave. lida accept my suggestion. I also ask can she give a sigaret ro me also, because i did not smoke in that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We agreed meeting at the deck where was workers smoking place.  Lida ask: why i have been distand and havent spoke to her? I told her how i felt myseld uncertain and thought that she dont want me. lida told that i have understand wrong and that she is interested about me. You can guess how my heart smile in that moment, how we both smile.

            We had 12 days time before i will leave to homa again. After that i will change to helsinki-stockholm line for rest of the summer. I would not come to Baltic anymore, before Lida will go back to Ukraine. Now it was clear that we want eachothers. That time was certainly the most wonderful time in our lives, ever. We were like teenagers, who hide their love, because workers in the ship was not allowed to have relationship with dancers and also it was not allowes to dancers also. We keep contact by messages all the time and we met eachother when we had time even when i were at work. Usually i workd until 06 or 07 and after that we met. We stay awoke and spoke, we were so tired, but happy. Sometimes we slep like few hours and get back to our work, sometimes we did not slept at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            One night i knew Lida were at the gym, i said to my colleague that i will visit in my cabin for toilet. For real i went to meet Lida at the gym. I play music, Bon Jobi Always. I took lidas hand and sais lets dance. We dance like small kids at school disco, i wanted to kiss her and i did that. I were our first kiss 7.7 at the gym. Oh my, how much i wanted her.
        </p>
        <p>In that night i finish my shift at 05. We went to the wrestling gym, it were bottom floor of the ship. No one would not disturbe us. Floor at the gym were soft, so we could just lay there and listen music. Lida is very acrobatic and she show me some movements with with gymnastic rings. She were so flexible and she move so smooth, shape of her body make me crazy. </p>
        <p>I askd Lida does she want to learn some wrestling techniques? It were good excuse to get close to her body. I teach her how to get away under someone by by bridging, if someone sit top of you. I think it was plesing techniques to Lida also, because we practise that many times. </p>
        <p>12.7 i had to leave from the ship. Back to home to Helsinki and after that change the ship to serenade. Even we had only spoke and kiss with Lida i felt so deep amotions againts her.  I were sad, because i knew i would not come back to the baltic anymore and could not see her anymore. We spens our last night together and watch sunrise from sundeck. Ship arrive to harbour, Lida wanted to bring me to port.  We could barely speak, Lida hug me and whispered to me: i hope we will meet some day Muiniekka.  I hope eaxctly the same. Lida turn around and walk back to the ship, i watch over my shoulder to see that lovely women one more last time.</p>
        <p>I get out from port and walk to the parking lot where my supervisor wait me. I was going to his home for party. I sat in his car and he ask how did it go ? I said i cant speak right now. Christian drive to the market and i cries for 20minutes in his car. In that moment i knew that i have been falling in love, falling in love with women, who i will not see never again, that thought felt so bad.
